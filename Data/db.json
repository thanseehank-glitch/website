Distilling a century of horological innovation into a versatile 31mm silhouette, this timepiece is crafted from 904L Oystersteel—a superalloy typically reserved for the aerospace and chemical industries to ensure maximum resistance to corrosion and an exceptional polish. Beyond its striking aesthetic, the watch is powered by the high-performance Calibre 2232, a self-winding mechanical movement entirely developed and manufactured by Rolex. It features a patented Syloxi hairspring in silicon, providing ten times more precision than a traditional hairspring in case of shocks. With its signature waterproof Oyster case and the secure, comfortable three-piece link Oyster bracelet, the Oyster Perpetual 31 is not just a watch, but a lifetime investment in precision and prestige."
